### Isn't @repository required for class that extends JPA?

The @Repository annotation is not strictly required for a class that extends JpaRepository in Spring Data JPA. 

However, it is highly recommended because of the following reasons:

- Using the @Repository annotation clearly indicates that a class is a repository component, which improves the readability and maintainability of your code.
